This repository showcases a full-stack application built with Next.js for the frontend and NestJS for the backend.
The application demonstrates the power of combining these two frameworks, providing a robust, scalable, and efficient solution for building modern web applications.

- Next.js: Utilized for creating fast, dynamic, and SEO-friendly frontend applications with features like SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and SSG (Static Site Generation).
- NestJS: A powerful Node.js framework for building scalable backend applications with a focus on maintainability and performance, leveraging TypeScript and the latest design patterns.

The project includes essential features such as API integration, frontend routing, and data handling, allowing for seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
Perfect for developers looking to get started with full-stack development using modern JavaScript frameworks.
